Frontend Webapplication Design and Development

Open sTeam is a collaboration platform developed at the University of Paderborn in germany. It is no longer developed at the university, but still in use.

http://societyserver.org is built with a branch of sTeam, and its developer recently created a RESTful API interface for it.

In this project you will create a weblog frontend using the RESTful api. Using the ember.js framework you will develop interfaces to create, edit and show weblog posts. The design could be similar to the one on societyserver.org or it could be entirely different.
