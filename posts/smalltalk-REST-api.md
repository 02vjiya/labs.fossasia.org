To allow creating javacript websites with Smalltalk as a backend, implement a RESTful API to manipulate Smalltalk objects. (list, retrieve, update, add, delete)

Initially the API will focus on a narrow set of objects representing users and documents (files), and, if time allows, may expand to access any object in the server.
