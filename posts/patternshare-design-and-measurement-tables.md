Add Design items and Measurement Tables for Patternshare

Patternshare is a development project of a web application to edit pattern files for garments and textiles. The goal of the student project is to implement the choice of additional design items, e.g. different collar styles, and to add them to the patterns. Patternshare users should be able to generate non-custom sizes on the fly and add their own measurements table in the app. Another required feature is to add specific design items or changes, e.g. starting from size 36 up to 42. In order to establish a suitable way to allow the sharing of patterns in an industry quality, patternshare needs to support these features and be able to import and export CAD files.

Background: One of the main ideas of patternshare is to offer a web service that enables people to edit patterns independently from standard sizes. Similar industry software packages including Assyst (www.assyst-intl.com), Lektra (www.lectra.com), Grafis (http://www.grafis.com) and other exist. Grafis in particular seems to generate patterns in the same way, that we do it in patternshare - based on formulars which are defined from pattern descriptions from standard books. Many standards defined in books from Mueller und Sohn for example. The current players do not aim at the maker and SME market.
