title: implement a REST API server in Smalltalk
layout: index
---
To allow creating javacript websites with Smalltalk as a backend, implement a RESTful API to manipulate Smalltalk objects. (list, retrieve, update, add, delete)

Initially the API will focus on a narrow set of objects representing users and documents (files), and, if time allows, may expand to access any object in the server.

Skill Level: medium

Useful Skills: Smalltalk, REST

Mentor: Martin BÃ¤hr
