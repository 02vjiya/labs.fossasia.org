Tasks:

* Projects have to be compatible to Ayab, Knitic, Passap, OpenKnit, others DIY knitting machines
* New plugins for the various hacks
* Implement features for pattern creation and pattern changes
* Add pro-features like: Set of repeating pattern drawing pixel, converting scans of sample slides to pixel patterns etc.
* We would love it if there is a generic, open format for knitting patterns
* In addition a function to control to the pixel / color data rate and e.g. also the type to use for the carriage
as well as the width of the knitting mill (per line)
